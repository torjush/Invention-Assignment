# Invention-Assignment
This repo contains the code and data used for the invention assignment in the course TI2716 - Multimedia Analysis at TU Delft spring 2018

### The project
Using data from usage of household objects in three different homes, we are trying to see if it is possible to find out which home the data comes from.

### Data
The data is collected by a TI Sensortag attached to different household objects. All data is contained in field folder in json format. One file for each day.

### Package dependencies
See conda_env.txt for the complete list of packages used in our anaconda environment.

## Running
- Clone this repo.
- Make sure that your python environment fulfills the requirements from conda_env.txt.
- Make sure that you are running python from the Invention-Assignment directory.
