# Invention-Assignment
Invention Assignment for the course TI2716 - Multimedia Analysis at TU Delft spring 2018

## The project
Using data collected by a TI Sensortag attached to household objects in three different homes, we are trying to see if it is possible to find out which home the data comes from.

## Data
The data is found in the field folder in json format. One file for each day.

## Package dependencies
See invention.txt for the complete list of packages used in our anaconda environment.
